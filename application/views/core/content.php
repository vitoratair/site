								I was 16 when a got my first job, I was teacher's  assistant of many courses, like excel, fireworks, corelDRAW, photoshop. There I learned and met people important to my career. I kept this job for about 7 month, until I started a course about computer maintenance. In this course my teacher invited me to work in his computer store, I stayed there for about 6 month and realized that computer maintenance isn't for me. After that, the brother in law of my friend,  knew that I worked with photoshop and coreldraw, he has a design company and invited me to work with him, I liked a lot and my corelDRAW's skills got better.

								This internship was great to me, I learned with some great guys. My main function was validation a DECT platform into the telephone TS60, it was my first contact with software development, even didn't doing any kind of development, I thought, I really liked and some day I gonna develop like this guys. So, I went to library, took  the <b>C completo e total</b> book and started learning C programming.

								I was finishing my Technical course in networks and was trying learn more about this with a job, and I found a perfect one. The main function of Product validator is test all features with many scenarios to approve or not the product. In this time I was learning a lot about <b>GNU/Linux</b> and <b>FreeBSD</b> system to improve my tests and also making some scripts in bash or perl. It was a great time and I learned a lot about network and its protocols. Nowadays I'm using this knowledge to do better softwares.

								Here I understood what is a product, what is important to think when a product it's in development. Some of my main functions was to help marketing guy, specifying a new product, talking to clients to understand a little bit more about market and why this product should be developed. I always brought some to think about, be it with canvas, design thinks, scrum or any things to help us to understand our client's need, thus making our team more productive. At this point I started thinking more about the user, and not just develop something that anybody would like to enjoy or use. This knowledge was very important to my whole life, influencing all my work and study until now.

								My current job, after learning a lot about networks, programming, operating system and just as importantly as, the users needs, agile development methodologies and startup's culture. I was prepared to work just with software, and to my happiness, a new department was created and I was invited to work with them. So, I'm work with a django platform to development a wireless control manager, this software tests me a lot, because I need use all my knowledge at Linux system and networks protocols besides back-end and front-end programming. I'm happy here, but I'm always looking for new challenges to make my knowledge bigger and bigger.
